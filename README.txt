This is just a simple game I made to further my understanding of Python.
I used sprites from the Open Sourced game "Super Tux" which can be found here: https://github.com/SuperTux
I do plan on continuing to develop this game, but I would not expect quick developments.


Keyboard Controls for game:
Move Left: a
Move Right: d
Jump: w OR Spacebar *You can double jump*
Quit mid game: q
Quit after death: n
Continue after death: y

Objective:
Gather as many coins as you can while dodging the falling ice blocks and incoming snowballs.

Difficulty:
The game increasingly becomes more difficult as the ice blocks and snowballs respawn.
Each respawn increases their speed.
